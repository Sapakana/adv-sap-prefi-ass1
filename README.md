## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
answer:SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces. Services use common interface standards and an architectural pattern so they can be rapidly incorporated into new applications.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
answer:
1)Loose Coupling - SOA services are self-contained entities that communicate with each other via well-defined interfaces. Because changes in one service do not have a direct impact on others.
2)Interoperability - SOA promotes interoperability by allowing various applications to communicate and collaborate regardless of the languages of programming or technologies used.
3)Reusability - SOA services are intended to be reusable, which means they can be used in a variety of applications and contexts.
4)Discoverability -SOA services usually become registered and discoverable through a service registry This registry enables other services to dynamically find and use services that are available.
5)Service Lifecycle Managemen - SOA entails a well-defined service lifecycle, which includes planning, coding, testing, installation, and maintenance.
3. Define Microservices.
answer:Microservices or microservices architecture is a cloud-native architectural approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
answer:
1)Modularity and Scalability - Microservices divide applications into smaller, separate services, each of which handles a specific company's ability.
2)Technology Diversity - Different technologies and programming languages can be used to implement various services within a microservices architecture.
3)Fault Isolation - Because microservices are self-contained, a failure in one of them does not necessarily affect the entire system.
4)Improved Team Productivity - Improved team productivity results from teams working independently and the ability to work on specific services.
5)Enhanced Scalability - Microservices architecture improves scalability by allowing for a horizontal expansion of individual services.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
answer:
1)Service-Based Architecture - SOA and Microservices are both based on the idea of structuring software systems as a set of offerings.
2)Loose Coupling - Both architectures encourage loose coupling of services. This implies that changes to one service should not have an immediate effect on others.
3)Interoperability - This encourages the integration of various systems within a company.
4)scalibity - Scalability is supported by both architectures, allowing systems to deal with increased workloads. In both SOA and Microservices, support can be scaled on their own based on demand.
5)Reusability - Both architectures' services are intended to be recyclable, lowering redundancy and increasing development efficiency.
